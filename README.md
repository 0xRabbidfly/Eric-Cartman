## 🤔 What is This?

**Eric Cartman** is a meta prompt library — a springboard of Gen AI IDE artifacts to bootstrap any project with agentic development capabilities. Whether you're using GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, or other AI coding assistants, this library provides battle-tested prompts, skills, and scaffolding to get you off on the right path.

### Why "Eric Cartman"?

Because Cartman is the ultimate meta-prompter. He knows exactly how to manipulate situations to get what he wants. Your AI agents should be just as effective (but, you know, for good).

- **Workarounds** — Solutions to framework/library quirks
- **Debugging Techniques** — Effective debugging patterns
- **Project Conventions** — New conventions established during the session

**Output Locations:**
| Pattern Type | Saved To |
|--------------|----------|
| Quick rules | `copilot-instructions.md` |
| File-specific rules | `instructions/*.instructions.md` |
| Complex workflows | `skills/*/SKILL.md` |

### 6. 🗒️ Session Log

**Capture session insights and metrics for later analysis.**

Logs checkpoint snapshots and end-of-session summaries into `.github/sessions/` so other skills can analyze what happened over time.

**3 Modes of Usage:**
- **Checkpoint** — `/session-log checkpoint` auto-extracts recent insights/challenges/metrics

- **Message** — `/session-log "..."` logs a specific note (auto-categorized)

**Use When:**
- You want lightweight logging during a long session
- You want a structured end-of-session summary for later reference
- You want to build a dataset for process improvement over time
- You want to capture friction points and successful workflows as you go

| `research.md` | Adds new decision entries |
| `data-model.md` | Keeps in sync with TypeScript types |
| Diagrams | Updates Mermaid and ASCII architecture flows |

**Core Principle:** If code exists, docs should describe it. If code changed, docs should be updated. If a task is done, it should be checked off everywhere.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This library follows key principles for effective agentic development:

1. **Progressive Disclosure** — Metadata first, details on-demand
2. **Right-Sizing** — Skills should be 100-500 lines, not monolithic
3. **Clear Triggers** — Every skill has explicit "When to Use" scenarios
4. **Actionable Output** — Graded scores and specific remediation steps
5. **Cross-Platform** — Works with Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and more
