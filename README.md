## 🤔 What is This?

**Eric Cartman** is a meta prompt library — a springboard of Gen AI IDE artifacts to bootstrap any project with agentic development capabilities. Whether you're using GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, or other AI coding assistants, this library provides battle-tested prompts, skills, and scaffolding to get you off on the right path.

### Why "Eric Cartman"?

Because Cartman is the ultimate meta-prompter. He knows exactly how to manipulate situations to get what he wants. Your AI agents should be just as effective (but, you know, for good).

Suggests running when it notices discrepancies between docs and reality (chunk counts, phase status, missing skills).

```
📍 Location: .github/skills/repo-state-sync/
```

### 15. 🪞 Skill Reflection

**Composable after-action review that any skill can invoke at the end of its workflow.**

Analyzes friction encountered during a skill run and produces prioritized, advisory recommendations for improving the calling skill's SKILL.md. Tracks friction history across runs — if the same issue appears twice, it auto-escalates to P0.

**Use When:**
- At the end of any multi-step skill workflow
- After a skill encounters friction (errors, workarounds, retries)
- After a successful run that still had rough edges
- When a user says "reflect on that run" or "what could be improved"

**Design Principles:**
| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|
| Generic | Knows nothing about specific skills; receives context as input |
| Composable | Called inline by other skills, not standalone |
| Advisory | Produces recommendations, never edits SKILL.md directly |
| Cumulative | Tracks friction history to detect repeat issues |

**How Other Skills Compose With This:**

Add this as the final step in any skill's SKILL.md:

```markdown
### Step N: Reflection (composable)

Invoke the `skill-reflection` skill with:
- **Calling skill**: `<skill-name>`
- **SKILL.md path**: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **Steps completed**: list each step with pass/fail/skipped
- **Friction notes**: any workarounds, retries, unexpected errors
```

**Priority Levels:**
| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| P0 - breaking | Will cause failure next time — must fix before next run |
| P1 - quality | Causes retries or confusion — should fix soon |
| P2 - nice | Minor clarity improvement — fix when convenient |

**Escalation Rule:** Same friction point in two consecutive runs → auto-escalate to P0.

```
📍 Location: .github/skills/skill-reflection/
```

### 16. 📡 Daily Research Pipeline

**Automated daily AI research pipeline that writes to your Obsidian vault.**

Scans 5 topic tracks (agents, skills, models, MCP, RAG) across Reddit and X, deduplicates against vault history, and writes a structured daily note with reading list and per-topic breakdowns. Tag `#keep` to promote posts to your long-term Library.

**Use When:**
- Daily research habit for staying current on AI developments
- Scanning specific topics across Reddit and X
- Building a curated research library over time
- User says "daily research", "what's new in AI", "run pipeline"

**Cost:** ~$0.05-0.15/day (~$3/month) using scan mode with gpt-4o-mini.

**Invocation:**
```bash
# Full daily run (all 5 topics)
python .github/skills/daily-research/scripts/run.py

# Single topic
python .github/skills/daily-research/scripts/run.py --topic agents

# Preview without writing to vault
python .github/skills/daily-research/scripts/run.py --dry-run
```

```
📍 Location: .github/skills/daily-research/
```

### 17. 📓 Obsidian Vault Operations

**Composable wrapper for Obsidian CLI — the sole interface for all vault operations.**

Thin, composable wrapper around the Obsidian CLI (v1.12+) that other skills import to interact with the vault. Supports read, write, search, tags, properties, tasks, daily notes, backlinks, and more.

**Use When:**
- Any task needs to read, write, search, tag, or query the Obsidian vault
- Other skills need to persist output to the vault
- User says "save to vault", "obsidian", "research note", "daily note"

**Key Operations:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|--------|
| Files | `read`, `create`, `append`, `prepend`, `move`, `rename`, `delete` |
| Search | `search`, `search_context` |
| Daily Notes | `daily_read`, `daily_append`, `daily_prepend` |
| Properties | `property_read`, `property_set`, `properties` |
| Tags | `tags`, `tag_info`, `tags_for_file` |
